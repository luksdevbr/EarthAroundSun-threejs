# Earth Orbit Simulation

A simple and interactive 3D simulation of Earth orbiting the Sun, built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). This project visually represents the heliocentric model using realistic textures, animations, and lighting effects in a browser environment.

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – 3D graphics engine
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – Fast development server & bundler
- JavaScript (ES6+)
